# Current implementation status

Audit of the implementation in progress, for both Claude and the user. Claude updates this file **before** starting
an implementation and again **when it is done** (or blocked). It covers only implementations from 2026-10-11 onward.

### Progress
- [ ] Docs/tracking: spec decisions
- [ ] Application: `IAppTeamReader.GetTeamIdsForUserAsync`, `CanWatchIncident` query, hub payload DTOs
- [ ] Infrastructure: `RedisAppTeamReader.GetTeamIdsForUserAsync`
- [ ] Api: `IIncidentClient` (6 methods), `HubGroups`, `IncidentsHub` rewrite
- [ ] API-CONTRACT.md §7
- [ ] Tests: hub groups/watch, probe rewrite, handler, validator, client contract

### Blockers / open questions
None. Decided 2026-10-13: `dashboard:{teamId}` + `team:{teamId}` groups; stale membership accepted until reconnect; responder groups follow the token role; `GetOwningTeamIdAsync` moves to 09_02.

### Previous implementation (07_03)
Done (906 tests green, format clean); review pending. Edit endpoint `PATCH /incidents/{id}`.

### Previous implementation (07_02)
Approved (QA 865/865, security 1 Low, code review 1 Medium fixed / 5 Low); committed as `24d65aa`. Open non-blocking items: L1 the detail is read after the commit (one projection would help); L2 `Users.AnyAsync` is redundant before `IsMemberAsync`; L3 closed-incident 409 comes after the assignee/team lookups; L4 name the `(IncidentStatus)(-1)` sentinel; L5 a concurrent team delete would surface as 500. QA Lows: vacuous `allowedTransitions >= 0` assertion, rollback test uses `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`, the `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` to 409 path has no endpoint test. Security Low: transition `note` is stored unsanitized.

### Previous implementation (07_01)
Approved (QA 810/810 + plan test, security 3 Low, code review 2 Medium / 5 Low); committed as `38a3e72`. Open non-blocking items: M1 severity rank is written four times in `ListIncidentsHandler` (one shared expression); M2 keyset tie-break branches untested (seed identical `CreatedAt`/`UpdatedAt`); L1 `IncidentPermissions.AllowedTransitions` is a pass-through and the create mapper still calls the workflow directly; L2 detail takes three round trips; L3 `severity` and `-updatedAt` sorts are not plan-tested or indexed; L4 add a stop-word-only `q` case and note the 500-id cap in API-CONTRACT; L5 sort token parsing lives in the controller.

### Previous implementation (06_01)
Approved (QA 673/673, security 1 Low, code review 4 Low); committed as `a2bba9d`. Open non-blocking items: L1 the "opt-in" performance test also runs in a plain `dotnet test`; L2 `Handle_UnknownApplication` does not isolate the missing-application branch; L3 `'Closed'` literal in the raw SQL; L4 a hint can include an incident closed between search and projection.

### Previous implementation (05_02)
Approved after review round 3 (QA 637/637, security 0 findings, code review 2 Low); committed as `7656473`. Open non-blocking items: L1 stock `RequestSizeLimit` filter may log a "could not apply limit" warning on requests with an `Idempotency-Key`; L2 bodies over 30 KB are buffered to a temp file; Teams/Applications creates without an `Idempotency-Key` still use Kestrel's 30 MB default.
